## Name
French Energy Consumption Analysis with Stochastic Models

## Description
We have chosen to delve into the French energy consumption public data bank.

We will try to apply tools studied in Stochastic Modelisation class to give some insight on the data provided. This will include some notions like:
- copula
- Gaussian processes
- Hawkes processes
